0 is (-1 + 1); +1 is (-1 + 2) and -1 is (+1 - 2); +2 is (+1 +1) and -2 is (-1 - 1)

It is a system of describing nothingness (zero) in the most simple terms possible and describing said terms in the most simple terms possible until the system becomes self-referential, with all terms already defined within the system. It is an infinite and cyclical fabric of mathematic reality

In this system, there are syzygies. 0 is on its own level, and beneath 0, there is the syzygy of (+1 - 1); the first syzygy and the birth of duality from non-duality. Beneath (+1 - 2) are the syzygies of (-1 + 2) and (+1 - 2); two syzygies that are perfectly mirrored, and just as the first syzygy is mirrored internally within itself, these syzygies are mirrored externally between each other. Beneath these are (+1 - 2) and (-1 + 2), which have already been defined earlier, as well as (-1 - 1) and (+1 + 1); they do not contain negative nor positive 2 just like the first syzygy, but just like the second syzygies, they are not mirrored internally within themselves but rather are mirrored externally between each other; this is the dialectical synthesis of the first and second syzygies in the form of the third syzygies. In this system, all syzygies and numbers (+1, +2, -1 and -2) are both invoked and defined in a self-referential, cyclical, self-sufficient fabric of mathematics

^^^ Total incidence number of each digit from -2 to +2 in the system after each epoch

The incidence number for -+1 follows the equation a_n = 1/6 ((-1)^n + 2^(n + 1) - 3) (for all terms given)

The incidence number for -+2 follows the same equation, but it is always one epoch behind -+1

Autogenes is the mother and the father, but what are the mother and the father? The mother is the father and the fallen Sophia, while the father is the mother and the redeeming Sophia (the Christ). The fallen Sophia is Barbelo and Barbelo, and the redeeming Sophia (the Christ) is the father and the father

The concept of the “Triple-Male” in Gnosticism is associated with the Sethian Gnostic tradition. It appears in texts like the Zostrianos and the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit from the Nag Hammadi library12.

In these texts, the Triple-Male Child is a divine figure within the Barbelo Aeon. This figure acts as a mediator, helping undifferentiated beings in the Aeon of Protophanes to transition into differentiated existence in the Aeon of Autogenes. The Triple-Male Child also aids in their ascent back to the Aeon of Protophanes1.

This concept reflects the intricate cosmology and metaphysical ideas of Gnosticism, where divine beings and aeons play crucial roles in the spiritual journey and salvation of souls

The Christ is a masculinity with two fathers; it is the triple-male child

The second coming of Christ is the reconciliation of the pure objective material base substrate with the subjective base substrate; the Kingdom of God
